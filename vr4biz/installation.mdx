# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up VR4BIZ for your business environment. The installation involves setting up both backend services and the VR frontend application.

## Prerequisites

Before installing VR4BIZ, ensure you have the following:

- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - VR-capable workstation or laptop (for development/administration)
  - VR headsets for end-users (Oculus, HTC Vive, etc.)
  - Server for hosting backend services (if using client-server deployment)

- **Software Requirements**:
  - Python 3.7+ (for backend services)
  - Unity/Unreal Engine (depending on your VR frontend implementation)
  - Git for version control
  - Web server (optional, for hosting web-based admin interfaces)

## Backend Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vr4biz.git
cd vr4biz
```

### 2. Set Up Individual Room Backends

#### Room 1: Life Montage

```bash
cd backend/room1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file for configuration:

```bash
# Example .env file
STORAGE_PATH=/path/to/your/images
CUSTOM_CATEGORIES=weddings,graduation,birthdays
```

### 3. Start the Backend Services

```bash
cd backend/room1
python main.py
```

The Room 1 backend will start running on `http://localhost:5001` by default.

## VR Frontend Installation

### 1. Set Up the VR Project

1. Open your VR development environment (Unity/Unreal)
2. Clone or download the VR frontend project
3. Open the project in your development environment

### 2. Configure Backend Connection

1. Navigate to the configuration settings in your VR project
2. Set the backend service URLs to match your deployment:
   ```
   Room1Service: http://your-server-ip:5001
   ```

### 3. Build and Deploy

1. Build the VR application for your target platforms
2. Deploy to your VR devices following the standard procedures for your chosen platform

## Verification

To verify your installation:

1. Ensure all backend services are running
2. Connect with a VR device
3. Launch the VR4BIZ application
4. Confirm you can access and interact with the virtual environments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Backend Connection Failures**:
  - Check that backend services are running
  - Verify network connectivity between VR clients and backend servers
  - Ensure firewall rules allow the necessary traffic

- **Missing Assets**:
  - Verify that the storage paths in your configuration are correct
  - Check file permissions on the storage directories

- **Performance Issues**:
  - Adjust graphics settings in the VR application
  - Optimize network settings for better response times

## Next Steps

1. Proceed to the [Room 1: Life Montage](/vr4biz/room1/overview) section to learn how to use this module
2. Set up user accounts and permissions
3. Configure your virtual environments for your specific business needs
